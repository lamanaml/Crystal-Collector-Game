# Crystal Collector Game

## Introduction

> Crystal-Collector-Game is a Javascript app that generates a random number.  The user selects a combination of crystals that have been assigned an unknown value.  The goal is to select the right combination of crystals that will add up with the random number.  

## Code Samples

> You've gotten their attention in the introduction, now show a few code examples. So they get a visualization and as a bonus, make them copy/paste friendly.

## Installation

> The installation instructions are low priority in the readme and should come at the bottom. The first part answers all their objections and now that they want to use it, show them how.
